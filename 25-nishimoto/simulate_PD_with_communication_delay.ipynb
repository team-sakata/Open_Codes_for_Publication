       "['This player is cool-headed and unflappable, unlikely to be swayed by guilt or anxiety. Low agreeableness makes them skeptical and self-interested: they favor competitiveness over harmony, are blunt, and readily exploit trusting partners. Low conscientiousness adds inconsistency and impulsivity—plans and promises are unreliable, and they may switch tactics without much deliberation. In repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma play they tend to defect early and opportunistically, taking advantage of others when it benefits them, but they won’t obsess over retaliation or remorse. Overall they’re pragmatic and aloof: calm under pressure, strategically self-serving, and unpredictable in follow-through.',\n",
       " 'Low agreeableness, low conscientiousness, and high neuroticism produce a distrustful, emotionally volatile player in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. They prioritize immediate self-interest, are unsympathetic to partners, and default to defecting rather than cooperating. Impulsivity and poor follow-through make their strategy inconsistent: they may accept a short-term cooperative gain but are likely to abandon or renege if anxious or provoked. High anxiety and reactivity lead to quick retaliation and difficulty forgiving perceived slights, so punitive cycles are common. Only clear, reliable signals of mutual benefit and safety will sometimes coax this player into sustained cooperation.',\n",
       " 'This player is highly conscientious, emotionally calm, and low in agreeableness. They are disciplined, methodical, and principled—reliably following rules and a clear strategy—yet skeptical, competitive, and unwilling to prioritize others’ feelings. In a Prisoner’s Dilemma they won’t be swayed by guilt or panic; instead they adopt a consistent, self-protective tactic. Absent firm guarantees of reciprocity they tend to defect to avoid exploitation, but they will cooperate when cooperation is structured, reliably reciprocated, or clearly in their long-term interest. Predictable and steady rather than conciliatory, they punish untrustworthy partners strategically rather than emotionally.',\n",
       " 'Very low agreeableness, very high conscientiousness, and very high neuroticism (extraversion and openness unspecified/average) produce a cautious, self-protective player. They are disciplined and methodical about strategy, but deeply mistrustful and easily shaken by perceived betrayal. Expect consistent, rule-driven play that prioritizes avoiding exploitation: they’ll favor strategies that punish defections and minimize uncertainty (grim-trigger or harsh tit-for-tat), are slow to forgive, and unlikely to initiate cooperative moves unless reciprocity is clear. Anxiety heightens vigilance and reactivity, so setbacks can provoke sharp retaliation rather than negotiation. Overall: reliable in execution, competitive in intent, and emotionally brittle under conflict.',\n",
       " 'This player is warm and cooperative, strongly inclined to trust and help others in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Their high agreeableness makes them forgiving and oriented toward mutual benefit—they prefer cooperation, assume goodwill, and often give partners the benefit of the doubt. Low conscientiousness means they can be impulsive, disorganized, and inconsistent: they may fail to stick to planned strategies, forget to punish defections, or make careless selfish moves. Low neuroticism makes them calm and resilient under pressure, unlikely to overreact or escalate conflict. Overall, they tend to cooperate and restore cooperation quickly but can be exploited by disciplined, strategic opponents.',\n",
       " 'This player is highly agreeable, very neurotic, and low in conscientiousness. They enter the game inclined to cooperate, trusting and motivated to preserve mutual benefit, but they worry intensely about being exploited. Anxiety and sensitivity to perceived slights make them likely to overreact to a partner’s defection—responding with emotional, sometimes impulsive retaliation—yet their low conscientiousness undermines long-term, consistent strategy: they may stray from planned tit‑for‑tat, forget punishments, or switch choices erratically. Overall they are a friendly, peace‑seeking partner who oscillates between forgiving reassurance and panicked short‑term defections, cooperative but unreliable in repeated play.',\n",
       " 'Extremely high agreeableness and conscientiousness combined with very low neuroticism produce a player who is cooperative, dependable, and emotionally steady. In a Prisoner’s Dilemma they default to cooperation, value mutual benefit, and honor implicit or explicit commitments. Their conscientiousness makes their behavior consistent and rule-driven: they reward reciprocity, respond predictably to defection, and prefer strategies that sustain trust over time. Low neuroticism keeps them calm under pressure and unlikely to lash out or escalate after setbacks; they are forgiving and focused on long-term relationships. This profile promotes stable alliances but can be exploited by consistently opportunistic defectors.',\n",
       " 'This player is highly cooperative and dutiful: they value harmony, are inclined to trust others, and try to keep commitments. In repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma play they’ll usually cooperate, follow agreed strategies, and respond reliably to fair behavior. But high neuroticism makes them anxious about being exploited; they watch for signs of betrayal, feel stress after defections, and may switch to cautious or punitive moves if they worry the partner won’t reciprocate. Clear rules, communication, or reassurance restore their trust quickly. Overall: a dependable, pro-social partner whose cooperativeness is strong but emotionally fragile when trust is threatened.']"
